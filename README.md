iSongShow
=========
iSongShow is an iTunes plugin/helper app that displays the name of the current track in a stylish fade-in/fade-out window when the track changes.
This is an old project (it's from 2005, according to the copyright notices in the files) that surprisingly still works with the latest versions of iTunes. Thanks for the backwards compatibility, Apple!
